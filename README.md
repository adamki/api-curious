This is the first individual project of Module 3 at the Turing School. Students have to use an API, in this case Github, to build a clone of said platform.
The backend is Rails.

##Getting Started:
* clone this project `git@github.com:adamki/api-curious.git`
* run `bundle`
* start the DB `rake db:migrate`
* run on `localhost:3000`

## Learning Goals
* learn to consume Data from third-party APIs.
* Continue to emphasize performance, UI/UX.
* Continue to use TDD to drive all layers of development.
* Coordinate with project staekholders to produce quality code and product.
* this project will be completed in a short period of time, 4 days.

## Technical Expectations
* Use an Omniauth authentication library for authenticating users from the third-party service.
* Mimic the interface of functionality of chosen third-party, in this case Twitter.
* Consume an external API to get real data and interact with a third-party service.
